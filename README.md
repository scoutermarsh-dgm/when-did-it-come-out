Group name: What year did it come out?
Group members: Sailor Coutermarsh and Monique Parker
Reflection: 

Sailor: Overall, our project went pretty well.  It didn't end up working but we were really 
close to getting to that point. I think coding, throughout the whole year, was really fun because 
I love working with computers.  I would definently look into this as a job in the future!
Thank you for everything! :)

Monique: overall I think that this project went pretty well. I thought the hardest part was putting the pictures in that we neeed because we couldnt really figure out how to make them smaller so we only have
one picture on there. I honestly didnt really like coding because its not my thing but my dad works with computers.
